INTRODUCTION

Remember how XMMS1 let you search your playlist in real time by pressing "j".
Now you can have the same functionality with XMMS2! xmms2_jump is a simple
XMMS2 client that provides only this feature. It is intended to be bound to an
accelerator key so you can quickly start the program, search, and get back to
what you were doing.

This is xmms2_jump version 0.01.  The first public release!
It is somewhere between alpha and beta quality, I hope.


INSTALLATION

xmms2_jump requires the following packages:
SCons, in order to build it (any version should be fine).
GCC with C++ support.  A recent version of libstdc++ might be necessary.
Boost.  Only tested with version 1.33.1.
Gtkmm (2.4 API).  Only tested with version 2.8.3.
XMMS2 (of course).  Only tested with DrJekyll.

Just run scons to compile.  Please report any compilation failures on the wiki,
and *please* include the version numbers you have for all of those libraries.

To install, copy xmms2_jump-makedb and xmms2_jump-query to somewhere in your
path.  Copy (or link) xmms2_jump-monitor into your XMMS2 startup directory
(defaults to $HOME/.config/xmms2/startup.d) and restart XMMS2 (this will ensure
that stale indexes are not used).  Then just run xmms2_jump-user_query.sh to
start searching your currently active playlist.  It will take a little while to
start up the first time (and the first time after you change your playlist)
while it builds an index.  The index is stored in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/xmms2_jump (or
$HOME/.cache/xmms2_jump, if XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set).


LIMITATIONS

I have only tested this program with "list" style playlists, not "queue" or
"pshuffle".  You can try them if you want, but I make no promises.
